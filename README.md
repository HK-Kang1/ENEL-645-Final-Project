## Overview

This project investigates the task of **age estimation from facial images** using deep learning. Age estimation is a complex yet impactful problem in computer vision, with key applications in **security, healthcare, marketing, and identity verification**. Unlike humans, who can instinctively estimate age from facial features, training machines to do so requires handling variability in appearance, lighting, and image quality.

Using the **UTKFace dataset** (20,000+ labeled images), we implement and compare three state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks:

- **MobileNetV2**
- **ResNet50**
- **EfficientNet-B0**

Each model is fine-tuned with custom layers and evaluated for performance across age groups. Images are categorized into four age bins:

- **0â€“25**
- **26â€“50**
- **51â€“75**
- **76â€“116**

In addition to classification, the project uses **Grad-CAM** (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize which regions of the face the models focus on during prediction, providing insight into the model's decision-making process.

> ðŸ“ˆ **Key Finding**:  
> **MobileNetV2** outperformed the other models, offering the best balance of accuracy and efficiency.

This study highlights how deep learning can improve **automated age recognition**, with potential benefits in **fraud prevention, targeted services, and personalized healthcare**.
